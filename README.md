# Tea project, Tea database

This is a collaboration project between Nina, a designer, and Justinas, a programmer. We both share a deep passion for tea and want to share that love with the world, which is why we decided to create a website dedicated to tea enthusiasts like ourselves. Through our site, you'll be able to explore various types of teas, learn more about their origins, brewing techniques, and dive into the rich culture surrounding tea. We also share our personal tasting experiences and expert recommendations to help guide your own tea journey. Additionally, this project doubles as Justinas' college semester project, so he is putting in extra effort to ensure it’s completed before the New Year. We hope you’ll find our site as enjoyable to use as we have found creating it!

        Black tea (also literally translated as red tea from various East Asian languages) is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white, and green teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also, rarely, used.[2]

        Many finished black teas consist of blends of various varieties of black tea. In addition, black tea is often blended with various other plants or flavourings in order to obtain a beverage. 
            - Earl Grey tea
            - Lady Grey tea
            - English breakfast tea
            - Irish breakfast tea
        Brewing
            Generally, one uses 0.08 ounces (2.26 g) of tea per 8 US fl oz (237 ml) of water.[14][better source needed] Unlike green teas, which turn bitter when brewed at higher temperatures, black tea should be steeped in water brought up to 212 °F (100 °C) for 3–5 min.[15][better source needed]
