# Tea project, Tea database

This is a collaboration project between Nina, a designer, and Justinas, a programmer. We both share a deep passion for tea and want to share that love with the world, which is why we decided to create a website dedicated to tea enthusiasts like ourselves. Through our site, you'll be able to explore various types of teas, learn more about their origins, brewing techniques, and dive into the rich culture surrounding tea. We also share our personal tasting experiences and expert recommendations to help guide your own tea journey. Additionally, this project doubles as Justinas' college semester project, so he is putting in extra effort to ensure it’s completed before the New Year. We hope you’ll find our site as enjoyable to use as we have found creating it!
